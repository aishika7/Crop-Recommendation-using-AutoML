# 🌱 Crop Recommendation System using IBM Cloud

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Crop Recommendation System** built using **IBM Cloud services** (no coding required).  
It analyzes soil and environmental parameters to suggest the most suitable crop for cultivation, helping farmers make **data-driven decisions** that improve yield and sustainability.  

---

## 🏷️ Problem Statement
Farmers often struggle to choose the right crop due to:  
- Lack of access to scientific, data-driven insights.  
- Dependence on traditional knowledge that may not suit changing weather and soil conditions.  
- Resulting in **low yield**, **financial losses**, and **uncertain outcomes**.  

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
- A **cloud-based AI system** that uses IBM AutoAI to analyze soil and climate data.  
- Provides **personalized crop recommendations** to farmers.  
- Built entirely on **IBM Watson Studio** with no manual coding.  
- Ensures **scalability** and **ease of use** for multiple stakeholders.

## 🔧 IBM Cloud Services Used
- **IBM Watson Studio** → For building, training, and managing the project.  
- **IBM AutoAI** → For automated model selection and optimization.  
- **IBM Db2 on Cloud / IBM Cloud Object Storage** → For storing and managing datasets.  
- **IBM Watson Machine Learning (WML)** → For deploying the model as a service and testing it in real time.  

---

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Dataset Upload** → Stored in Db2 / Object Storage.  
2. **Model Training** → AutoAI pipeline created in Watson Studio.  
3. **Model Evaluation** → AutoAI tested multiple models and selected the best one.  
4. **Deployment** → Model deployed on IBM Watson Machine Learning.  
5. **Prediction** → Users enter soil & weather parameters → system recommends the best crop.
